Abby lives in Ada, OK and is a member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma but did not grow up in a Choctaw speaking household. 

She has heard the language spoken in a Choctaw church when she was young and by a couple of older relatives. 

Abby knows just a few words like Halito (Hello/Greetings) and placenames like Bokchito.

She wants to learn the Choctaw language and more about her traditional culture and realizes that the family elders whill not be around forever.
