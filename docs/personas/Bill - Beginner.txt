Bill is a non-native employee of the Choctaw nation and wants to improve his job outlook by learning to speak Choctaw in the work environment.

He does not have any experience with the language other than seeing the words on signs within the Choctaw Nation offices, and the signs have English alternatives so that is what he uses to navigate.

He needs to pick up the basic vocabulary quickly before his annual review in three months.
