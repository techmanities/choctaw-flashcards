Christine is a retired public school teacher with basic computer skills and general knowledge of her smartphone.

She grew up in a Choctaw speaking household and spoke Choctaw in the home until she started elementary school. The teachers in her school disapproved of her lack of English skills and she was held back a year so she could catch up with the other students with English grammar and vocabulary.

Based on her early experiences, she felt embarassed and quit speaking Choctaw even refusing to speak Choctaw to her family because it was "indian" and she wanted to be "modern".

She remembers very little from her childhood 60 years ago, but has recently become interested in learning about her Native heritage and abandoned language.

She is now the matriarch of her own family, but is unable to answer the questions from her grand-children that are taking Choctaw language classes in their school.

Her goals are to catch up to her grand-children's language skills and to be able to converse with them exclusively in Choctaw when they come to visit.
