Dennis is a non-native high school student learning Choctaw as an elective by taking classes in school with his best friend Eric.

Dennis knows a little about the languge and culture since he has grown up with Eric since elementary school and has spent so much time at Eric's house.

While not native himself, Dennis wants to help others learn the language and wants to be a language teacher after college. He has seen Eric's family grow in the language community and wants to be a part of that experience.

Dennis is very technology oriented like most people of his age and is looking for a technology solution to help him learn the Choctaw vocabulary and memorize lots of words on his path to becoming fluent as possible being a second language Choctaw speaker.
